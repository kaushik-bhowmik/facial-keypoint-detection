# Facial-keypoint-detection
In this projects, using deep learning, I worked on detection of facial keypoints.
The pipeline for the project:
1. Loading and visualizing the dataset.
2. Preprocessing the imagedaset for training images and testing images separately.
3. Defining the CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) architecture.
4. Training and testing of CNN model.
5. Using the CNN model & Haar Cascade Classifier, detecting the number of persons in a image and detecting their facial keypoints.
6. Later using facial keypoints of an image and adding filters to the person's image.
